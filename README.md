# AutoFailsafe
Triggers failsafe automatically when colonists get attacked by monsters. It would spend accumulated Sanctified Points of an attacked colony to damage current horde of zombies.

No new blocks or big changes â€” just adds an automatic trigger to an existing system. You can still use button to trigger it manually.
Notifies all colony owners on trigger.

Could create some errors in server log, but nothing crashing or breaking the game.
My first attempt with coding CS, so needs testing and polishing. Beware!
